## With GUI

### Working with file archives

Download the tool `7-zip` from its official [page](https://www.7-zip.org/) and run the installation.

### Verifying checksums

Download the tool `md5summer` from its official [page](https://www.md5summer.org/) and extract the zip.

## Without GUI

The practical is not covering Windows command-line tools but you can refer to `certutils` and `7za` if you want to try the steps without GUI.
